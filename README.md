## ShiftCoin - You Spend, While we take care of the Speed, Safety, Security

### The problem it solves: 
With the growing industry and evolution of new technologies, the thing which is the most concerning to us is the speed and the privacy statements that the technology is providing. In a world, where WEB3 is growing rapidly, we found a lack of a proper platform that provides us the opportunity to use this technology in real life. Even if we found any of such platforms, they mostly fail to keep a safe, secure, and transparent environment for us. So, we started from the very basics of sending "cryptos" among one another and keeping track of the person who is sending and to whom, the amount, and time. For better results, we have kept the track in sorted order. We have tried to keep a simple yet attractive UI for the users so that they can use it without any hassle. 
This is the first step towards a safe, secure, and transparent digital world of CRYPTOS.




### Challenges we ran into

During the process of building the ShiftCoin application "related to transactions", we encountered several challenges. Some of these challenges included:

1. User Onboarding and Education:
- Lack of Blockchain Knowledge: Many users are not familiar with blockchain technology, MetaMask, or Web3. Onboarding them and educating them about these concepts can be a significant challenge.
- Complexity: Understanding how to set up and use MetaMask and interact with Web3 can be daunting for newcomers.
2. Security Concerns:
- Phishing and Scams: Users need to be protected from phishing attacks and scams, as malicious websites can attempt to impersonate legitimate ones.
- Private Key Security: Managing private keys securely is essential to prevent unauthorized access and theft of funds.
- Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: Developing secure smart contracts and ensuring they are free from vulnerabilities is crucial to preventing loss of user funds.
3. Transaction Speed and Cost:
- Network Congestion: Blockchain networks like Ethereum can experience congestion, leading to slow transaction processing and high fees.
- Gas Fees: Users may be discouraged by the high gas fees required for transactions, especially for small transactions.
4. Cross-Browser Compatibility:
- Ensuring that MetaMask and Web3 work consistently across various web browsers can be challenging due to differences in browser support.

## Further Plans
1. We are working on showing previous transactions (transaction date and time, transaction amount, Sender's ID, Receiver's ID).
2. We are working on to add a NFT Marketplace.
